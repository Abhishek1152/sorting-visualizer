# Sorting-Visualizer
This is my version of Sorting Visualizer with features like dynamic user array and change in sorting speed while sorting is in progress. Feel free to play with its feature. Any suggestion or feedback would be appreciated. (Please note the visualizer is not responsive. For best experience use full screen size). https://abhishek1152.github.io/sorting-visualizer/
